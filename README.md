# Basic-Weather-App
Create a command-line weather app in Python using Flask and HTML that fetches and displays current weather data for a user-specified location (e.g., city or ZIP code) using a weather API. The app should show basic information such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions, while ensuring real-time and accurate data presentation.
